FOR MY THEME SONG MY LEATHER BLACK JEANS ON

-!-- SECOND IN DEPTH REVIEW ---

The album is finally here after waiting five years (to be honest I only know travis since late 2019, so this isnt entirely true for me). This is my second review after around ten relisten.

Previous to the release I really had very low expectations. Even though his recent features on H&V by Metro were good, any other feature in the last year was garbage. And after the release of K-POP i was entirely sure he wants to stay relevant by all means so Utopia will be a mix of some commercial successful songs. Make a new Sicko Mode, put some safe features on here and don’t take a risk.
And to be fair, currently any major rap release seems to fail at the audience. Either the current releases are spiceless mainstream albums songs like Gunnas, Young Thugs or also Futures album from last year or failed steps into “rage” or more experimental directions like Trippie Redd or Uzis latest project.

But this project is no failure. Travis did both, on the one side he stayed relevant with banger tracks which mostly not lack of being interesting enough to stand up from the huge amount of rap songs out there. On the other side he also experimented a lot and brought out some new stuff.

Firstly I have to admit this album is nothing entire new. It is very much influenced by Kanye and especially by Yeezus. The beat of MODERN JAM interpolates I Am A God, which is produced by 1/2 of my beloved house duo Daft Punk and the drums on CIRCUS MAXIMUS are kinda similar to Black Skinhead. Also the entire esthetic and the abrupt beat switches are similar to Yeezus in general. But I’m not surprised by this at all especially because Travis early success was his production on Kanyes project.

Talking about the production on this album, it is very incredible. Looking into the “Song Info” texts on spotify it seems Travis mainly produced most of the songs by himself, obviously with the help of the synth god Mike Dean and other great musicians. Also Kanye had a huge part into the production of the album. GODS COUNTRY and TELEKINESIS are originally Kanye beats/snippets. While GODS COUNTRY comes a little bit short, TELEKINESIS is an awesome final version of “Future Sounds” with incredible features by SZA and Future.

And as I expected, Travis never lacks of Features. We got awesome verses from Drake on MELTDOWN, Thugger on SKITZO (which is a little bit long), Cudi on LOOOVE, surprisingly Beyonce on DELRESTO and two times 21 Savage on TOPIA TWINS and TIL FURTHER NOTICE. Plus a new The Weeknd feature on CIRCUS MAXIMUS. I love any of these “banger” tracks. These aren’t something new but they all feel very refreshing.
I didn’t even regognize Carti on FE!N, mainly because i’m not the biggest Carti fan, but the song is a hit.

If we dig further into the feature list, Travis also includes new people into this project. We got Tezzo Touchdown on MODERN JAM, KayCyy ok THANK GOD and Rob49, someone I’ve never heard of on TOPIA TWINS. These features are adding soo much new tone to the tracklist, its insane.

At last, James Blake and Bon Iver are fitting so good on this album. They are such a great contrast to the other guest on this project.

But this mainly stays a Travis project. He has some great flow variation from his very slow flow on PARASEIL and I KNOW? to straight heat on HYAENA. But also mainly because this is a Travis project, the balance between production, features and his own verses is way more important than his ability to rap.

Okay, so far its a good Travis project but nothing unexpected, right? No, wrong. After the weird intro and especially after listening to MY EYES! i was stunned. The psychadelic feeling Travis’ built is such a renaissance back to Rodeo while not feeling like a leftover from this era. This song will definately land in my Top 5 or 10 Travis songs. Also PARASEIL completely stunned my introducing the great Yung Lean into the project. The same goes for SIRENS. Both songs sounded completely different from his rest.
The album closes perfectly with TIL FURTHER NOTICE

In Conclusion i think Utopia is a very good album, K-POP is still mid but the rest of the track list is awesome. Unfortunately it lacks of the perfect Transitions Astroworld had and it also a little bit messy. I don’t think this will surpass Astro and Rodeo in my Discography ranking but its right behind these two.

-!-- INITIAL THOUGHTS ---

omgomgomg it is here so live track rating I have to do it. I will sound either like the biggest fanboy or hater lets see
HYAENA: What an unexpected Intro, sets the tone right for the album. What a flow 😁
THANK GOD: Production is Ye and Mike’s Synths are the best, KayCyy feature is a little bit quiet but great 😁
MODERN JAM: Production from Guy-Man of Daft Punk?! wtf such a vibe, can’t recognize the features tho (Edit: Its Tezzo Touchdown omg yes) 😁
MY EYES: The sample is great, sounds like a Stranger Things instrumental. omg the Sampha feature yesss. Omg plus a beat switch ok wow. So far every song is strong, not breathtaking but strong. 😁 (Edit: This is literally the best from the album now 💯)
GODS COUNTRY: This is the sample I’ve waited for. I think his flow is underwhelming, could be more 🤷‍♂️
SIRENS: I guess this was also leaked before but can’t recognize it. Fire sample, fire flow. Mike Dean killed that Synth before the outro (I always just guess that must be Mike). Is that Drake spoken word? 😁 (Edit: I looove this sample and the experimentations 💯)
MELTDOWN: Omg the Six God Himself. Travis made Drake sound like a slaughter gang member lol. We all know Travis wanted to make Sicko Mode 2.0 here. Great song 😁
FE!N: Sounds like a rage beat oh no. Okay Carti is on here this is fire. FEIN FEIN FEIN FEIN. Ok idk who the other feature is tho, is that Yeat? (Edit: No its also Carti) 😁
DELRESTO (ECHOES): Fire sample as always. Omg my queen Beyonce what a surprise. Sounds like a song from Lemonde but the bridge sounds like Coldest Winter from Ye. Plus outro from what i guess Bon Iver is, is great 💯
I KNOW?: Travis sounds okay but nothing unbelievable here. Little bit slow 🤷‍♂️ (Edit: Nah this one is great as well 😁)
TOPIA TWINS: Who is this first feature?? But this one is fire for sure. Omg 21 Savage hell yeah, he is fire expected nothing else. Ahhh I love it 😁
CIRCUS MAXIMUS: Intro must be Swae Lee, beat sounds like Black Skinhead from ye. Omg the chorus!! Omg the Weeknd what this song is a ten, plus the outro yeah this is the one I’m gonna listen to on loop 💯
PARASAIL: This sounds nothing like Travis wow the autotune layering is awesome. Don’t know who the feats are on this one 💯
SKITZO: Yes Thugger is back this is what I needed. What is this beat I’m melting away. Banger track 😁 (Edit: A little bit long, still great)
LOST FOREVER: We already know this one it’s awesome, but they changed the beat for Westside Gunns part. I think I like the leaked one more tho 😁
LOOOVE: Production is great, weird beat switch, omg its getting so aggressive feels soo much like Yeezus. Omg yes Cudi my boy. 😁
K-POP: We already know this one, it okay but it doesn’t fit on the album. Glad we got a second Weeknd feature earlier 🤷‍♂️ (Edit: Kinda grew on me tho)
TELEKINESIS: Ohhh this is Future Sounds the scrapped track from Ye and Travis. Future feature is fine. Okay fuck it SZA killed it 💯
TILL FURTHER NOTICE:  James Blake on an outro is so fitting. Omg this is a long outro, another 21 Savage feat 😁 (Edit: This song is so good, I love the chorus with James & Travis, it’s a perfect album closer and one of the best on the album 💯)
=> This album has no song on I hate. Album could be a 8/10 or more, my expectations really were fulfilled. This really feels like an improvement since Astroworld
