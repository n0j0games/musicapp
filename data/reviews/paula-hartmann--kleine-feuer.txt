‚¨áÔ∏èüî• KLEINE FEUER

I've waited soo long for this one. "Nie verliebt" was one of the best albums of 2022, such a magical album with it's fairy tale aesthetic and love as it's main topic. While this album is quite similar in it's topic it feels way more rough. It moves a little bit further away from plain pop and includes more drums, hip-hop production and also a variety of german rap artists as feature guests. Some of the features work well, some dont. Paula Hartmann and her and producer Biztram dived into a variety of new sounds on this project and most of them work with sucess. Songs like "kleine Feuer", "zwischen 2 und 5", "gebrochenes Glas" and "Candy Crush" sound different from her previous songs, while still sticking to the topic of love. Same as before, Paula is awesome at using metaphors.
