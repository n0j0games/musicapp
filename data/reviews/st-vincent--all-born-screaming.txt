I've never heard any St. Vincent project before but I checked out her single "Broken Man". After the chorus hit with this guitar riff playing in the background ... I was instantly hooked and therefore I couldn't wait for this album to come out.

The album starts very calm and chill. Despite the title, "Hell Is Near" sounds very heavenly. Imo this song is about the love for some person and the following track "Reckless" is about totally losing it because the love is not returned. The terrific tone switch during the outro of the song amplifies the lyrics to another level. "Broken Man" continues this level of terrific energy, by her lyrics and the use of great guitar riffs.

"Violent Times" sounds like a total James Bond song. What an amazing track. I really like the horns & trumpets on this one. She got reborn with this one after being broken for the last five tracks. (This one might be the best track so far)

"The Power is Out" is another dark track. I don't quite get the context of this song compared to the previous one but it's an anthem for an apocalypse. Again, the chorus is stunning (She really has a hand for guitars)

I'm not very crazy about "Sweetest Fruit". The line about SOPHIE is very weird. Only downside of the album so far. Productionwise this is still great.

"All Born Screaming" is one of the wildest outro songs I've heard in a while. Crazy instrumental towards the end. The 6-minute long track is definitely one of the highlights of the album.

Amazing project all in all. I might have to check out her other projects as well
