"Whole Lotta Red" - Beyonce on "YA YA"

I wasn't a huge fan of TEXAS HOLD EM and I feared that this would just be really plain Country music. Like RENAISSANCE, Beyonce switched everything up and remixed classic Country music with modern beats and more experimental grooves.

I also feared the 27 song long tracklist, which is wayyy to long for my taste. RENAISSANCE was compact and each song was unique and instantly recognizable. While I think that this album feels never boring at any point, I don't get some of the very short songs and skits on here (1 minute length or below). They're fine but I don't get her vision for them.

The album starts with AMERIICAN REQUIEM, an epic 5-minute long opener I really enjoyed. It's followed by BLACKBIIRD, sampling the song from the Beatles, which Paul McCartney always considered as a song for a black woman, so its fit perfectly. PROTECTOR, DAUGHTER and BODYGUARD are soft and smooth tracks I also really enjoy. Despite it being a classic country song, I also enjoyed JOLENE.

Unfortunately I don't enjoy the features on here. I personally never really liked Miley, but I think she fits on this album. Post Malone instead is a bad pick as a feat. imo. Edit: Nevermind, I really enjoy them

And then there's this huuge shift in genre. While I like soft Beyonce, I really appreciate her agressive tracks way more, like the first half on RENAISSANCE. SPAGHETTII, YA YA and SWEET HONEY BUCKIN follow this practice and build the top 3 off this album for me.

Finally AMEN perfect closes the circle when it interpolates AMERICAN REQUIEM.

The album is a little bit too long and didn't need 27 songs, but still is an amazing attempt on Country music or whatever genre she created with this one.
