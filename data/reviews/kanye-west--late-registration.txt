This might be his best work

When I became a late Ye fan back in 2020, I always ignored this album. The College Dropout had the best sampling, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best features, Yeezus the most experimental production and Graduation the most hits. This album was fine but just a second College Dropout.

Now I'd say this is the Kanye album that aged the best. I love the soul/jazz samples on this one way more than on The College Dropout. While you can argue that Late Registration has not as much classics as TCD like Jesus Walks, All Falls Down and Through The Wire, I'd say that some tracks on here are equally considered classics. Gold Digger might be overplayed but it's THE Kanye West club song.

In contrary to The College Dropout, this album is way more mature. TCD has some very childish lyrics I won't say aged that well. This was his peak as a rapper in terms of verses, flows, and songwriting. Roses is one of his best written songs and Hey Mama is heartfelt and always brings some tears to my eyes.

This is one of the albums where you just have to listen to it as a whole, while most songs are equally good and consistent.   After Ye's downfall in the last year, this and Yeezus were the only albums I kept relisten over and over again.
